Linux Chat .sh
---------------

About: This program is developed by SureRouge502 automating the process of communicating from linux to linux device.
       This program uses Net-cat, A Networking Utility used for reading or Writing from TCP or UDP sockets using an easy interface.
       This program can only be used for Communication,Literally...SO if you're thinking to read and write actual files from linux to linux using this..it's just not for that.
       Lets move on to the Installation process then...



Installation: 
--------------

Its quiet easy if i say so myself. infact just one piece of code to install all tools required to run this program

---> First, Give executable abilities to the program and the installer itself using the code 'Chill.. u only need to do this once'

chmod +x install.sh linuxchat.sh

--->Now that you've given the executable permissions, You can now start the installation process itself by typing the command:

./install.sh

--->After that, you should get a message saying Installation complete and now you're ready to run the program itself
    In-order to run the program whenever u need it to...run the command

./linuxchat.sh

Enjoy the program...
